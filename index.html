    <h1>About this Assignment</h1>
    Hi, Ishrat!
    <p></p> <!--I don't think this is the right way to use these, but it always worked in JavaDoc and seems to work here.-->
    I don't really have any notes about this one, since I'm fairly confident I hit all of the requirements. Hopefully I continue
    to get silly pictures of this brainless cat to include in my assignments since it makes them fun to do (and hopefully more fun
    to grade).

    <h1>Week 3 content</h1>
    <div class="boxContainer" id="threeboxcontainer">
        <div class="threebox" id="week3left">
            This column is being used to display content on the left. If I wanted to, I could also nest a list below this.
            <ul>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
                <li>Item 3</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="threebox" id="week3center">
            This column is being used to display content in the center. I will now embed an image here.

        <div class="threebox" id="week3right">
            This column isn't doing anything fancy (just some text). But it's still the same length as the other two!

    <h1>Examples</h1>
    This section contains some examples of links.
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./examples/ex_download.txt">Open a .txt file in your browser.</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ETSells/ETSells.github.io">Link to a website (My github.io repo).</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ETSells.github.io">And this should bring you right back here!</a></li>
    </ul>
    You've made it to the end! Here's a cat.
