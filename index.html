    <h1>About this Assignment</h1>
    Hi, Ishrat!
    <p></p> <!--I don't think this is the right way to use these, but it always worked in JavaDoc and seems to work here.-->
    When it comes to programming assignments, I tend to learn better by throwing myself in the deep end
    and forcing myself to figure it out. I went through your week 1 follow along which is where most of this
    came from on the HTML side, but largely am attempting this week's on my own. If there's something I 
    missed, please let me know!
    <p></p>
    Just a quick note: I interpreted #4 as asking for our HTML document to have two parents and two children.
    There's a possible interpretation where maybe this was asking for it on the CSS side? I hope I got this right.

    <h1>Lessons</h1>
    This is another section that is getting linked to by nav. There is nothing important here.

<section class="body" id="Examples">
    <h1>Examples</h1>
    This section contains some examples of links.
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./examples/ex_download.txt">Open a .txt file in your browser.</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ETSells/ETSells.github.io">Link to a website (My github.io repo).</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ETSells.github.io">And this should bring you right back here!</a></li>
    </ul>
    You've made it to the end! Here's a cat.
